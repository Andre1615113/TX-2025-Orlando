TechExchange 2025 Lab User Information

This repository contains individual user information files generated for the TechExchange 2025 lab environment. Each file provides specific details for a single student, extracted and cleaned from a combined dataset.

Files Included

Individual text files, named StudentX_info.txt, where X corresponds to the student's sequential number (e.g., Student1_info.txt, Student2_info.txt, etc.), are available.
